How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User needs are an important part in software development because they allows you to build the product exactly how the client wants it. Using something like user stories allows you to easily view and incorporate what the users want from your product. For me, putting the user stories into a document made creating new features much easier. Once one was completed, the next would be right there ready to be added.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My approach to developing programs is by taking it one step at a time. Some projects can be very daunting to look at, but it is important to take a step back and look at it in pieces. This way you can avoid being overwhelmed and still quickly finish the project. The biggest agile process I want to use in my future work is the Scrum-agile process. This method allows for easy collaboration among team members, while also being very efficient in developing a product. Simple things like scrum meetings allow me to stay on task and work through problems with very little headache.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means being open to new ideas. Innovation requires risks to be made and thinking outside of the box should be encouraged. There are no bad ideas when trying to be creative and that should be stressed to each member. Encouraging cooperation in a judgement-free zone allows each member to grow and connect which can greatly help them in their future groups or projects.
